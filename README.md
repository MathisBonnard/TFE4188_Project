# TFE4188_Project

The is the work repository for our project in the course TFE4188–Advanced integrated circuit at NTNU.
The aim of the project is to make a digital-output temperature sensor.

The design is a 3-bits output with a sensing range from -13.5 to 70.5°C. The precision is approximately 14°C/bit.

If you want to download and build the project, you will probably need to rebuild some paths in the schematic.

# Group members

The project was made by 2 students at NTNU: Brandon Lawrence and Mathis Bonnard.

**Brandon Lawrence** is a third-year student studying a double degree
in Physics, and Automation and Robotics at the University of Western
Australia. He is currently completing an exchange semester with
the faculty of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering at
NTNU

**Mathis Bonnard** is a fourth-year student in the master Electronic
System Design at NTNU. He is in double degree with the french
engineering school Ecole centrale de Nantes where he studied Product
Engineering.
