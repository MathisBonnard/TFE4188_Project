# TFE4188_Project

The is the work repository for my project in the course TFE4188–Advanced integrated circuit at NTNU.
The aim of the project is to make a digital-output temperature sensor.

The design is a 3-bits output with a sensing range from -13.5 to 70.5°C. The precision is approximately 14°C/bit.

If you want to download and build the project, you will probably need to rebuild some paths in the schematic.
